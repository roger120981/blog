## Unoffice Hours

Inspired by other [bloggers](https://unofficehours.com), I've recently decided
to open my calendar to a little serendipity. Anyone can book a 30 minute video
call with me about, well, anything.

Some ideas to chat about:

- General catch-up
- Discuss a blog post I've written
- Web development
- Training: calisthenics, climbing, powerlifting, nutrition

## Social Networks

I don't use social platforms often, but I do check them from time to time for
message requests. Please note that my response may be slower through these
avenues.
