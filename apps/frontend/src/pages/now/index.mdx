## What am I up to?

### Coding

Currently learning data visualization related libaries (pandas, plotly, etc.)
and making some plots of data from the IFSC World Cup as I learn.

### Training

- **Calisthenics**

  Currently focused on unlocking the handstand push-up and
  [planche](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planche_(exercise)>).

- **Climbing**

  I discovered the joy of board climbing this year and now most
  of my climbing is on the [Kilter
  Board](https://settercloset.com/pages/the-kilter-board).

  My current PR on the Kilter Board is V9 and I hope to get to V10 one day.
  Climbing is secondary to calisthenics training at the moment.

If you'd like to follow my training progress, I post every now and then on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tonydang.blog/).
