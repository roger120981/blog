## What am I currently up to?

### Coding

I'm in process of rebuilding this blog to better understand frontend frameworks.
Specifically, I'm learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/),
[Lit](https://lit.dev/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Training

- **Calisthenics**

  Currently foucsed on unlocking the handstand push-up and
  [planche](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planche_(exercise)>).

- **Climbing**

  I've recently discovered the joy of board climbing and now most
  of my climbing is on the [Kilter
  Board](https://settercloset.com/pages/the-kilter-board).

  My current PR on the Kilter Board is V8 and I hope to get to V10 one day.
  However, climbing is secondary to calisthenics training at the moment.

If you'd like to follow my training progress, I post every now and then on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tonydang.blog/).
