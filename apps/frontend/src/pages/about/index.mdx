# About

I created this blog with the assumption that visitors will mostly be friends and
acquaintances, but for everyone I’ve not yet met, here’s a quick summary of who
I am—

## Me in 5 bullet points…

- Born and raised in the SF Bay Area.
  Attended college in Southern Calofronia at the
  [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu).
- Professionally a mechanical engineer and engineering project manager, but
  currently on an [indefinite sabbatical](/a-nomadic-experiment).
- Unprofessionally a fledgling web developer and fitness-enthusiast.
  Or, as I like to call it, a [&lcub;dev&rcub;athlete](/devathlete).
- When I’m not writing code nor training at the gym, I’m most likely meditating,
  listening to podcasts, or journaling.
- [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality), minimalist, learner,
  unconventional thinker, spontaneous yet strategic.
