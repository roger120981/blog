# About

I created this blog with the assumption that visitors will mainly be friends
and acquaintances, but for everyone I’ve not yet met, here’s a quick summary of
who I am—

## Me in 5 bullet points…

- Born and raised in the SF Bay Area.
  Attended college in Southern California at the University of California,
  Irvine.
- Professionally a mechanical engineer and engineering project manager, but
  currently on an indefinite sabbatical.
- Unprofessionally a fledgling web developer, climber, and calithenics
  euthusiast.
- When I’m not writing code nor training at the gym, I’m likely meditating,
  listening to podcasts, or journaling.
- [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality), minimalist, learner,
  unconventional thinker, spontaneous yet strategic.
