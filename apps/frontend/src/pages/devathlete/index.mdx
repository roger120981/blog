At the end of 2019, I decided to [take an indefinite leave from my job as an
engineering project manager](/a-nomadic-experiment). The plan was to travel,
gain mental space, and discover the next path to take in life.

After two months of driving across the country and back in my
[subie](/subielife), the coronavirus pandemic hit, cutting plans for further
travel short.

I hunkered down and, instead of returning to the workforce, decided to live
life as if I were retired, trying to answer the question—_if I had all the time
in the world and no obligations, what would I spend my time doing?_

Six months later, I had the chance to look back and see how I've spent my time
during the past half year.

The answer was clear. There were two things I did consistently everyday:

1. Learn and write code—specifically web development to build this blog
2. Train physically—specifically calisthenics and handstands

Have I found my path in life? Am I a developer and an athlete?

A **&lcub;dev&rcub;athlete**?

I still don't know for sure, but this is the path I choose to create for myself
right now…
