The IFSC World Cup is an annual series of climbing competitions organized by
the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) and includes what I
consider to be the best indoor rock climbers in the world.

As I watched the 2022 season, I often found myself wondering, "What is the
average age of the best climbers in the world?"

To answer this question, I gathered the ages of all athletes who made it to a
World Cup final in 2022 and plotted the following charts. This includes any
athlete who made it to the finals round of any of the 3 climbing disciplines
(boulder, lead, and speed) as well as athletes who made it to the finals round
of the combined boulder & lead event.

## All Finalists

From the data, it appears that **the age range of climbing finalists in the
2022 IFSC World Cup is 16-35 years old, with the average age being 22 years
old**.

I was curious to see if the age distribution would be different among boulder,
lead, and speed categories, so I also plotted the age distribution of each
discipline separately.

## Boulder Finalists

  <BoulderDark slot="dark" />

## Lead Finalists

<PlotlyPlot>
  <LeadWhite slot="white" />
  <LeadDark slot="dark" />
</PlotlyPlot>

## Speed Finalists

<PlotlyPlot>
  <SpeedWhite slot="white" />
  <SpeedDark slot="dark" />
</PlotlyPlot>

What was most surprising to me was that the average age (22 years old) stayed
the same even when looking at the 3 disciplines separately!

Please feel free to explore the data yourself and let me know if you find
other interesting insights!
