## What am I up to?

### In search for a new job in web development

After 3 years since reading this [article](https://sive.rs/prog) and being
inspired to learn how to code, I've reached a point where I feel ready to put my
skills to the test in the real world. If you, or anyone you know, has advice on
finding my first developer job, I'd love to chat!

### Learning Elixir & Phoenix

On my quest to a find a productive web framework for a solo developer, I
stumbled upon [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and
[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). I'm currently doing a deep dive
into these two technologies and having a lot of fun learning them :)

### Practicing calisthenics

I'm slowing inching towards my goal of unlocking all the following calisthenics
skills:

- âœ… One-arm Pullup (OAP)
- âœ… Front Lever (FL)
- âœ… Handstand Pushup (HSPU)
- ðŸš§ Planche (PL)

I was able to finally achieve the handstand pushup this year. And currently, I'm
working on getting my OAP, FL, and HSPU more solid before I put full focus on
training the planche.

If you're interested in following my training progress, I occasionally post
updates on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tonydang.blog/).
