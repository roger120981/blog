## What am I up to?

### In search for a new job in web development

After 3 years since reading this [article](https://sive.rs/prog) and being
inspired to learn how to code, I've reached a point where I feel ready to put my
skills to the test in the real world. If you or anyone you know has advice on
finding my first developer job, I'd love to chat!

### D3 to Svelte chart conversions

As a learning exercise, I'm currently working on converting the official [D3
examples](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) to Svelte. You can follow along
with my progress [here](/d3-svelte).

### Working on my handstand pushup

Despite recovering from a shoulder and elbow injury I got from climbing, I'm
staying on track to achieve my goal of unlocking the handstand pushup this year.
I'm following a plan by [Yaad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQhrk6WMcKw) and
seeing great results! If you're interested in following my training progress, I
occasionally post updates on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tonydang.blog/).
