## What am I up to?

### In search for a new job in web development

I'm currently on the lookout for a new job in web development. If you or your
team is looking for someone with TypeScript and/or Elixir experience, I'd love
to chat!

### Learning Elixir & Phoenix

On my quest to a find a productive web framework for a solo developer, I
stumbled upon [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and
[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). I'm currently doing a deep dive
into these two technologies and having a lot of fun learning them :)

You check out projects I've been working on over on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/tonydangblog).

### Practicing calisthenics

I'm slowing inching towards my goal of unlocking all the following calisthenics
skills:

- âœ… One-arm Pullup (OAP)
- âœ… Front Lever (FL)
- âœ… Handstand Pushup (HSPU)
- ðŸš§ Planche (PL)

I was able to finally achieve the handstand pushup last year. This year, my
focus is 100% on training the planche.

If you're interested in following my training progress, I occasionally post
updates on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tonydang.blog/).
