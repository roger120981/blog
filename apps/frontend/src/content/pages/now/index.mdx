## What am I up to?

### Coding

Currently learning data and web visualization libraries
([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[plotly](https://plotly.com/),
[d3](https://d3js.org/), and
[three.js](https://threejs.org/))
and making some plots of data from the <abbr title="International Federation of Sport Climbing">IFSC</abbr>
World Cup as I go.

### Training

- **Calisthenics**

  Working on improving my handstands while slowing inching towards my goal of
  getting a [planche](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planche_(exercise)>) one
  day.

- **Climbing**

  I discovered the joy of board climbing this year and now most
  of my climbing is on the [Kilter
  Board](https://settercloset.com/pages/the-kilter-board).

  My current PR on the Kilter Board is V9 and I hope to get to V10 one day.
  Climbing is secondary to calisthenics training at the moment.

If you'd like to follow my training progress, I post every now and then on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tonydang.blog/).
