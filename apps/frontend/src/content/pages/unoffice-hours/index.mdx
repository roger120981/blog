# Unoffice Hours

Inspired by other [bloggers](https://unofficehours.com), I’ve decided opened up
my calendar for 30-minute video calls with you!

Yes you!

No agenda, no plan, and no need to email first. Feel free to bring your
favourite beverage and we'll chat about, well, anything. Some ideas are:

- A general catch-up - I'd love to hear about what you're working on
- Chatting about web development - Anyone into Svelte, D3, or Three.js?
- Discussing projects we can work on together
- Talking about training for climbing and calisthenics

Or whatever else. If you want to have a chat or discuss something, just book a
slot. I welcome anyone, whether we’re old friends or have yet to meet.

## Background

I stumbled upon the idea of Unoffice Hours from Dave Smyth's
[blog](https://davesmyth.com/unoffice-hours). I thought it was a neat idea so I
added it to my own website.

Unoffice Hours are a way to have spontaneous, chance encounters with people you
might not have met otherwise. It's a relaxed and informal setting, similar to
meeting a friend for coffee.
