# Unoffice Hours

Inpired by other [bloggers](https://unofficehours.com), Iâ€™ve decided opened up
my calendar for serendipitous calls about, well, whatever. Calls can be:

- A general catch-up
- Discussing web development
- Ways we can work together
- Talking about training for climbing or calisthenics

Or whatever else. If you want to have a chat or discuss something, just book a
slot.

## Background

I stumbled upon the idea of Unoffice Hours from Dave Smyth's
[blog](https://davesmyth.com/unoffice-hours). I thought it was a neat idea so I
added it to my own website.
