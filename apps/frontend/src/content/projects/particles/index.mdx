    # Particles

    Floating particles around a central nucleus. Loosely inspired by the
    structure of an atom.

    Drag to rotate, pinch/scroll to zoom.

      Created using custom WebGL shaders and rendered with
      [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and
      [react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction).
