In late 2019, inspired by [#vanlife](https://gnomadhome.com/vanlife-how-to/), I
decided to travel indefinitely while living out of a Subaru Outback.

I've gotten several questions about my setup, so in this post, I'll go over my
setup as well as share some helpful resources.

## Table of contents

## Subie

The base vehicle for my setup is a 2020 Subaru Outback.

  <figcaption>The Yeti 1400 Lithium Power Station by Goal Zero.</figcaption>
</figure>

To power items such as cellphones, fans, lights, and even a small fridge, I
have a dual battery system in my Subaru.

A dual battery system consists of hooking up a secondary battery to the car's
main battery, which allows the secondary battery to charge whenever you are
driving. This secondary battery can then be used to power anything even when
the car is not running.

With such a setup, you practically have infinite electricity as long as you
drive a couple hours each week to keep the secondary battery charged.

I have the [Goal Zero Yeti
1400](https://www.goalzero.com/shop/archive-power/goal-zero-yeti-1400-lithium-power-station-app/)
as the dual battery linked to the car's main battery. To create this setup,
you need the following accessories with the Yeti 1400:

- [Yeti Link Expansion Module](https://www.goalzero.com/shop/yeti-accessories/yeti-link-expansion-module/)‚Äî
  This expansion module is a required add-on to connect the Yeti 1400 to the
  car‚Äôs main battery and provide isolation so that the Yeti 1400 doesn‚Äôt
  drain the main battery.
- [Male EC8 to Ring Terminal Cable and EC8 12Ft Extension Cable](https://www.goalzero.com/shop/accessories/ec8-12ft-extension-cable/)‚Äî
  These cables connect the Yeti 1400 to the main battery.

Having a fridge that can run 24/7 in a car? Sounds pretty extra, right?
You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs probably not necessary to have a fridge, but it is super
convenient.

I have the CF-18 Portable fridge by [Dometic](https://www.dometic.com).

Having a bed platform creates a flat surface for a mattress and also has the
added benefit of extra storage beneath the bed. Resources I used to build my
own bed platform:

### Mattress

The mattress is a
[Zinus 5‚Ä≥ Memory Foam Mattress](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZ03ZCU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\*
(Quick shout out to
[Parked in Paradise](https://www.parkedinparadise.com/campervan-mattress/),
where I got the mattress recommendation from).

\*Note that this is a full-size 53‚Ä≥ x 72‚Ä≥ mattress, which is a little too
wide to fit into a Subaru Outback. The width was cut down by 10‚Ä≥ in order
to fit into the car. You can do this by removing the mattress cover and
cutting the foam underneath with a kitchen knife. The final mattress dimensions
are 43‚Ä≥ x 72‚Ä≥.

## Ventilation

Proper ventilation is important when spending extended time inside a car. Having
the windows up when camping in any small vehicle leads to depletion of oxygen,
build up of carbon monoxide, lots of condensation, and no air circulation. The
solution? Rolling down the windows. üôÉ But, what about rain and bugs? I‚Äôm glad
you asked‚Ä¶

### Window deflectors

<figure>

      "./_assets/13-subaru-outback-vanlife-oem-window-deflectors-1280px.jpg"
    )}
    alt="Subaru Outback Vanlife with OEM windowdeflectors"
  />
  <figcaption>OEM window deflectors installed on Panda.</figcaption>
</figure>

To be able to roll down the windows when it‚Äôs raining or snowing, you can
install window deflectors. Subaru makes sleek and straightforward to install OEM
deflectors for Outbacks and other Subaru vehicles.

You can buy OEM deflectors online at better prices than at car dealers. I
got my deflectors at [Subaru Online Parts](https://www.subaruonlineparts.com/).

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Th9wyAxLY) for an
example installation. Note that installation varies depending on the car‚Äôs
model and year.

  <figcaption>
    With deflectors installed, the windows can always be cracked open without
    fear of rain or snow getting inside.

### Window vents

    )}
    alt="Subaru Outback Vanlife Billetworkz window vents"
  />
  <figcaption>Window vents by Billetworkz.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, what about bugs? One solution is to use window vents.

Primarily used in the world of car rallying, [window
vents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6101Sgbskw&) are a way to allow for
airflow while keeping windows rolled up and not having to use a car‚Äôs A/C
system. These parts slide on top of your Subaru‚Äôs windows and have circular
holes in them to allow for airflow. These holes can have mesh in them to act as
a bug/dust screen while still allowing airflow.

The window vents I have are from
[Billetworkz](https://billetworkz.com/collections/window-vents) and have foam
mesh in them.

Window vents are a rather obscure item to find. If you don‚Äôt have a shop
nearby that can make them, and can‚Äôt find them online for your specific Subaru,
here are a couple alternative options‚Ä¶

1. Use a one-size-fits-all sunshade like
   [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YI3IGA6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
2. Make DIY window vents. It's not as clean looking, but it‚Äôs
   better than having bugs in your car. Some resources:
   - [Donovan Thurman‚Äî $5 Window Vents for Car Camping & Overlanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NQ42gkn2ag)
   - [Trail Benders Overland‚Äî Car Camping‚Äî DIY window bug screen mesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2frVeG8FXkY)

    )}

### Fan

<figure>
  <Image
    src={import(
      "./_assets/17-subaru-outback-vanlife-o2cool-portable-fan-1280px.jpg"
    )}
    alt="Subaru Outback Vanlife O2COOL portable fan"
  />
  <figcaption>Portable Fan by O2COOL.</figcaption>
</figure>

Another crucial item for ventilation is having a fan. In most vanlife setups, a
rooftop mounted fan is the way to go. But, that involves making a giant cutout
on top of your car‚Ä¶not something I wanted to do. Thus, I ended up getting a
portable fan. It is not as efficient as a rooftop fan, but it does the job.

The fan I have is the
[O2COOL 10-Inch Portable Smart Power¬Æ Fan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CLAL8S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

## Cargo box

You probably think there isn‚Äôt much space while living in a car. Well, you‚Äôre
right. There isn‚Äôt much space at all. With the bed taking up most of the back,
where do you keep any extra stuff? The answer: in a roof-mounted cargo box.

The cargo box I have is the [Yakima Skybox 16](https://www.yakima.com/skybox-16-carbonite).

## Lighting

    )}

A solar-powered lantern is useful to have to ensure you always have lighting
when out in the wilderness.

The lantern I have is the
[Goal Zero Crush Light](https://www.goalzero.com/products/crush-light).

## Water tank

Having a supply of water is crucial for any long road trip. But, since I didn't
plan to be far away from civilization, I decided on a smaller tank to save on
space.

The water tank I have is a
[3.5 Gallon Water Tank by WaterBrick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053GVRWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
with a
[spigot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MB3IXU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
for dispensing.

<figure>

    )}
    alt="Subaru Outback Vanlife with Waterbrick water tank"
  />
  <figcaption>3.5 Gallon Water Tank by WaterBrick.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Note on safety**: since this tank is kept on top of the mattress, one thing
to keep in mind is that anything on top of the mattress can come flying up
towards the windshield if not secured when braking. Thus, for safety, the tank
is secured with a
[quickdraw](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MW7BB7C?pf_rd_r=TAG2MVEBEFEK3ZFVP4WA&pf_rd_p=ab873d20-a0ca-439b-ac45-cd78f07a84d8)
to the car's back seat latch catch.

  />
  <figcaption>Water tank safely secured to back seat latch catch.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Privacy

### Window tint

One option to increase privacy is adding window tint.

If you happen to be in the SF Bay Area and need window tinting, I recommend
this [shop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/best-image-san-mateo) in San Mateo, CA.
Ask for their
[ceramic tint](http://www.johnsonwindowfilms.com/automotive-products/insulatir/)
for better thermal performance.

### Window covers

Even with window tint, there is not true privacy since light can still pass
through. For true privacy, you can make yourself a DIY set of window
covers‚Ä¶

## Cooking

I originally had a cooking setup, but I found that I never used it. Thus, I
decided to remove it in favor of buying foods that don't require cooking.

## Safety items

Besides the preceding items, here are some useful items to bring along for
safety:

- Offline GPS‚Äî I have both my phone with
  [offline maps downloaded](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
  and a [dedicated GPS device](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H274BN3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  with offline maps. Perhaps one day we will have absolute Wi-Fi coverage
  across the globe, but until then, better to keep offline options handy.
- [Carbon monoxide monitor](https://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/products/fire-safety/co-alarms/kn-cou-b/)
  ‚Äî**I found that this monitor did pick up small traces of CO (from me
  breathing) when the windows are rolled up. This is why I highly suggest
  having window vents and always leaving the windows cracked even if the
  weather outside is freezing.**
- [Rain‚ÄëX De-Icer¬Æ Windshield Washer Fluid](https://www.rainx.com/product/windshield-washer-fluid/rain-x-de-icer-windshield-washer-fluid/#.Xn7ks9NKhQI)‚Äî
  Although warned by my coworker beforehand, I forgot to change out my
  wiper fluid before getting to Washington, D.C. and my lines froze overnight
  in January.
- A portable jump starter or at least jumper cables‚Äî I haven‚Äôt had to use these,
  but a good safety item to carry for any vehicle.
- [Personal locator beacon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TXQYTTN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)‚Äî
  For the off chance that I wander into the wilderness. Having peace of
  mind knowing I can have help come my way in the most dire of circumstances
  is quite relieving.

## Whew, that was a lot‚Ä¶
