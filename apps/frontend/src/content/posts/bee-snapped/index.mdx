## What is Bee Snapped?

**Bee Snapped** is a portrait photography project started in 2018 when I
announced that I would snap _free_, studio-quality portraits for _anyone_ who
asked me. Since then, I've taken the **38 snaps** below.

## Would you like to bee snapped?

At the moment, I am not taking new appointments, but plan to in the future.
