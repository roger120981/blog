Ever wonder what shoes are worn by the world's best climbers? I do. Especially
when my shoes inevitably start forming holes every year or so. ðŸ˜…

The below charts highlight the shoes worn by all <abbr title="International Federation of Sport Climbing">IFSC</abbr>
bouldering and lead finalists in the 2022 season, arranged by brand and model
with the athletes' names grouped under their respective shoe model of choice.

This data was gathered visually as I watched the climbing finals this past
year, so my apologies if there are any inaccuracies. If you do find errors,
please let me know and I'll update the charts!

While these shoes may not be the best for everyone, I found that they are a
great starting point for someone like me, who is looking for aggressive
performance shoes for indoor climbing.

**Note:** the charts can be clicked to zoom in and out.

## Notes

1. Shoe models that come in both high volume (HV) and low volume (LV) are
   grouped together. Example: Drago and Drago LV are both just Drago.
2. The Five Ten Hiangle and Hiangle Pro are grouped together since several
   athletes appear to wear both interchangeably.
3. Mia Krampl appears to wear a different shoe on each foot - Scarpa Drago
   (right) and Scarpa Chimera (left).
4. Paul Jenft wears a shoe from EB Climbing, but it doesn't seem to be listed on
   their website.

## Sources

- All shoe data were visually obtained from event footage on the [IFSC YouTube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sportclimbing) as well as looking at the
  athletes' Instagram pages. The shoes listed here are what the athletes seem
  to wear most frequently during the world cup, but please note that athletes
  could have several different shoes and may switch to new shoes in the future.
