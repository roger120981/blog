Following up on my previous post on the [age distribution of IFSC World Cup
finalists](/ifsc-ages), I decided to also look at the heights of the finalists.
Unfortunately, I was unable to find height data for several of the speed
finalists, so I limited this dataset to only bouldering and lead disciplines.

The charts below show the heights of all athletes who made it to an IFSC World
Cup bouldering or lead final in 2022. This also includes any athlete who made it
to the final round of the combined boulder & lead event.

## Boulder & Lead Finalists

<div style="height: 450px;">
  <HeightHistogram
    data={boulder_and_lead}
    title="Histogram showing height distribution of boulder and lead finalists."
    mean_height_women={162}
    mean_height_men={175}
    client:only
  />
</div>

From the data, it appears that **in the 2022 IFSC World Cup, the heights of
women finalists were between 152 cm (5'0") to 175 cm (5'9") with an average
height of 162 cm (5'4"), whereas men finalists were between 163 cm (5'4") to
188 cm (6'2") with an average height of 175 cm (5'9")**.

I also plotted the height distribution of each categories separately to see if
there were differences between bouldering and lead disciplines.

## Boulder Finalists

<div style="height: 450px;">
  <HeightHistogram
    data={boulder}
    title="Histogram showing height distribution of boulder finalists."
    mean_height_women={162}
    mean_height_men={175}
    client:only
  />
</div>

## Lead Finalists

<div style="height: 450px;">
  <HeightHistogram
    data={lead}
    title="Histogram showing height distribution of lead finalists."
    mean_height_women={161}
    mean_height_men={174}
    client:only
  />
</div>

Unsurprisingly, there was little difference in average height between boulder
and lead groups since several athletes who participated in bouldering also
participated in lead events.

Please feel free to explore the charts yourself and let me know if you find any
insights. **Tip:** you can hover or tap on the charts to see toolips with
individual athlete information.

## Sources & Notes

- Aside from two finalists, Keita Dohi and Mia Aoyagi, all height data was
  obtained from athlete profiles on
  [ifsc-climbing.org](https://ifsc-climbing.org).
- Keita Dohi's height data was found on
  [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57241609).
- I was unable to find Mia Aoyagi's height data so it is not included in the
  preceding charts.
