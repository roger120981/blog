# Blog

This is the repo for my personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). The live site can viewed at [tonydang.blog](https://tonydang.blog).

The blog is a space for me to experiment with various web technologies as well as share useful things I create and learn.

## Cool things you can find there...

- Blog [posts](https://tonydang.blog/posts/) on data visualization and other topics.
- A [now page](https://tonydang.blog/now/) to see what I'm currently up to.
- Links to my [talks, presentations, and podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8lFmBcH3vX-JNIgxW3THUy7REthSRFEI).
- My [unoffice hours](https://tonydang.blog/unoffice-hours/) if you'd like to chat with me.
- Various projects I've worked on, including Three.js experiments such as:
  - [Possible Game](https://tonydang.blog/possible-game/) - A 2D box jumping jump inspired by the Impossible Game.
  - [Climbing Board](https://tonydang.blog/climbing-board/) - A 3D, interactive climbing board that allows users to create and view rock climbing problems.
