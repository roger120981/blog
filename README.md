# Blog

This is the repo for my personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). The live site can viewed at [tonydang.blog](https://tonydang.blog).

The blog is a space for me to experiment with various web technologies as well as share useful things I create and learn.

## Cool things you can find there...

- Blog [posts](https://tonydang.blog/posts/) on data visualization and other topics.
- A [now page](https://tonydang.blog/now/) to see what I'm currently up to.
- Links to my [talks, presentations, and podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8lFmBcH3vX-JNIgxW3THUy7REthSRFEI).
